SUBWAY RIDERSHIP FEATURE ENGINEERING SUMMARY
============================================

OBJECTIVE:
Create production-ready 24-feature dataset for ridership prediction

DATASET TRANSFORMATION:
• Input shape:              (1052709, 37)
• Output shape:             (1052709, 28)
• Features created:         14
• Features available:       24/24

FEATURE CATEGORIES:
• Temporal (12):            Raw temporal, cyclical encodings, derived indicators
• Weather (9):              Temperature, precipitation, comfort, and conditions
• Location (3):             CBD classification, latitude, longitude

VALIDATED PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED:
• Rush hours:               [8, 17] (Expected factor: 2.36x)
• Weekend effect:           0.63x
• Holiday effect:           0.66x
• CBD advantage:            2.52x
• Snow deterrent:           31.8% reduction
• Rain deterrent:           1.2% reduction
• Temperature comfort:      2.41x

NEW FEATURES BASED ON ANALYSIS:
• is_freezing:              Binary flag for temp < 0°C
• is_hot:                   Binary flag for temp > 30°C
• temp:                     Preserved for real-time predictions

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
• Cyclical features:        Validated in [-1, 1] range
• Binary features:          Validated as 0/1 encoded
• Pattern validation:       Completed using prior analysis benchmarks
• Missing values:           Checked and resolved
• Temperature extremes:     Evaluated for comfort dynamics

PRODUCTION READINESS:
• Real-time weather inputs: Supported
• Geographic interpolation: Enabled via lat/lon
• Station metadata:         Preserved for interface and mapping
• Feature pipeline:         Fully validated and reproducible
• Metadata:                 Stored in JSON with structure and rationale

IDENTIFIER COLUMNS:
• station_complex_id, station_complex
• latitude, longitude
• transit_timestamp

OUTPUT FILES:
• Modeling dataset:         ..\data\processed\modeling\subway_ridership_modeling_features.parquet
• Feature metadata:         ..\data\processed\modeling\feature_metadata.json

STATUS: READY FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT
Next step: Machine learning model training and evaluation

VALIDATION SUMMARY:
• 5/5 analytical patterns validated successfully
