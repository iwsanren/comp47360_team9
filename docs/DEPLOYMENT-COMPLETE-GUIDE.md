# Manhattan My Way Project - Complete Deployment Guide

## Project Overview
This is a complete guide for deploying the Manhattan My Way project, which consists of:
- **Frontend**: Next.js web application with interactive maps
- **Backend**: Python Flask ML API for taxi demand prediction
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers with Nginx reverse proxy

## Problems Solved and Solutions

### 1. Initial CI/CD Pipeline Issues

**Problem**: GitLab CI/CD pipeline was failing due to missing `.env` file in deployment directory.

**Root Cause**: 
- `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (correctly, for security)
- `cp -r . /deployment/dir/` doesn't copy ignored files
- `docker-compose.yml` uses `env_file: .env` but the file was missing

**Solution**: 
- Modified `.gitlab-ci.yml` to create `.env` file during deployment from GitLab CI/CD variables
- Added automatic environment variable injection:
```bash
echo "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=$OPENWEATHER_API_KEY" > .env
echo "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=$GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" >> .env
echo "NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=$NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY" >> .env
```

### 2. Docker Container Network Binding Issues

**Problem**: Services were not accessible from outside Docker containers.

**Root Cause**:
- Next.js dev server only bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) inside container
- Flask app only bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) inside container
- External requests to `http://137.43.49.26:3030` couldn't reach the services

**Solution**:
- **webapp/Dockerfile**: Added `--hostname 0.0.0.0` parameter
```dockerfile
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```
- **ml/app.py**: Changed Flask app binding
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)
```

### 3. Docker Volume Mount Issues

**Problem**: Volume mounts were causing deployment failures and file conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- Removed problematic volume mounts from `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Simplified container configuration to use only image builds

### 4. Environment Variable Configuration

**Problem**: Environment variables weren't properly passed to containers.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include all required environment variables
- Added `env_file: .env` configuration for both services
- Ensured consistent variable naming across all files

### 5. External Network Access Issues

**Problem**: Despite containers running correctly, external access to `http://137.43.49.26:3030` was blocked.

**Root Cause**: Network firewall/port mapping issues on the server.

**Solution**: Implemented Nginx reverse proxy
- Created `nginx.conf` with proper proxy configuration
- Set up automatic SSL and firewall configuration
- Mapped external port 80 to internal port 3030

### 6. Next.js Production Build API Key Issues

**Problem**: Mapbox API showing "An API access token is required" error in production.

**Root Cause**: Next.js requires `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables to be available during build time for client-side usage.

**Solution**: 
- Added build-time ARG and ENV variables in `webapp/Dockerfile`
- Updated docker-compose files to pass build arguments
```dockerfile
ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY
ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY=$NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY
```

### 7. GitLab CI/CD YAML Syntax Error

**Problem**: GitLab CI/CD pipeline creation failed with error:
```
Unable to create pipeline
`.gitlab-ci.yml`: (): did not find expected '-' indicator while parsing a block collection at line 22 column 5
```

**Root Cause**: 
- The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file had corrupted YAML syntax
- Multiline SSH script strings were not properly formatted
- Mixed indentation and malformed block collections

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with proper YAML syntax
- Used literal multiline strings (`|`) for complex SSH script blocks
- Fixed indentation consistency throughout the file
- Properly escaped shell scripts within YAML

### 8. GitLab Runner Not Available

**Problem**: Pipeline was stuck with error:
```
This job is stuck because the project doesn't have any runners online assigned to it.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Initially thought GitLab Runner needed to be installed locally on Windows
- Realized the Runner should be on the deployment server (Linux VM)
- The CI/CD jobs had `tags: - docker` but no matching Runner

**Solution**: 
- Removed `tags` configuration from `.gitlab-ci.yml` to use GitLab's shared runners
- Enabled "Run untagged jobs" in GitLab project settings
- Created scripts for installing GitLab Runner on Linux VM if needed later

### 9. SSH Permission Denied in CI/CD

**Problem**: CI/CD pipeline failed with SSH connection error:
```
Permission denied, please try again.
Permission denied, please try again.
student@137.43.49.26: Permission denied (publickey,password).
```

**Root Cause**: 
- SSH private key was not properly configured in GitLab CI/CD variables
- Or the corresponding public key was not on the target server
- SSH authentication failed between GitLab Runner and deployment server

**Solution**: 
- Created `setup-ssh-keys.sh` and `setup-ssh-keys.bat` scripts to generate SSH key pairs
- Scripts generate ed25519 keys and provide clear setup instructions
- Updated GitLab CI/CD variables with proper SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, DEPLOY_USER, and DEPLOY_SERVER
- Added public key to server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

### 10. Mixed Language Code Comments

**Problem**: Code files contained mixed Chinese and English comments and output messages.

**Solution**: 
- Standardized all code comments and output messages to English
- Updated all shell scripts to use English for consistency
- Maintained readability for international collaboration

## Current Session Deployment Issues and Solutions

### 11. Project Structure Analysis and Optimization

**Problem**: Initial confusion about project structure and whether frontend folder contained backend components.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `frontend` folder was actually a Next.js full-stack application
- Next.js API routes in `src/app/api/` provided backend functionality
- Unclear distinction between frontend and backend components

**Solution**: 
- Analyzed project structure comprehensively
- Identified Next.js as full-stack framework handling both frontend and backend
- Recommended renaming `frontend` to `webapp` for clarity
- Created clear documentation of project architecture

### 12. Machine Learning Model File Conflicts

**Problem**: Git merge conflicts with `ml/xgboost_taxi_model.joblib` file.

**Root Cause**: 
- `.joblib` files are binary serialized Python objects
- Git cannot automatically merge binary files
- Manual resolution required for binary conflicts

**Solution**: 
- Explained that `.joblib` files are scikit-learn/XGBoost model serializations
- Provided guidance on resolving binary file conflicts
- Recommended keeping the most recent model version
- Suggested using Git LFS for large binary files in future

### 13. Docker Configuration and Containerization

**Problem**: Need to containerize ML service and integrate with existing webapp.

**Root Cause**: 
- ML service (`ml/app.py`) was not containerized
- Missing integration between webapp and ML API
- No Docker Compose orchestration

**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive ML service containerization:
  - `ml/requirements.txt` with all Python dependencies
  - `ml/Dockerfile` with proper Python environment setup
  - `ml/.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` for multi-service architecture
- Configured service networking and environment variables

### 14. CI/CD Pipeline Selection and Configuration

**Problem**: Decision between GitLab Runner-based CI/CD vs. simplified SSH-based deployment.

**Root Cause**: 
- GitLab Runner setup complexity
- Server access limitations
- Need for reliable deployment without Runner dependencies

**Solution**: 
- Implemented dual-approach CI/CD configuration:
  - **Standard approach**: `.gitlab-ci-standard.yml` with GitLab Runner and Container Registry
  - **Simplified approach**: `.gitlab-ci-simple.yml` with direct SSH deployment
- Created automated deployment scripts with fallback directory selection
- Configured environment variable injection and Docker builds on server

### 15. Server Directory Permissions and Deployment Location

**Problem**: Uncertain server directory permissions and optimal deployment location.

**Root Cause**: 
- `/home/student` directory access restrictions
- Need for flexible deployment directory selection
- Permission-based deployment failures

**Solution**: 
- Implemented intelligent deployment directory selection:
  - Priority 1: `/opt/team9-deploy` (system-wide)
  - Priority 2: `$HOME/team9-deploy` (user-specific)
  - Priority 3: `/tmp/team9-deploy` (temporary)
  - Fallback: `$(pwd)/team9-deploy` (current directory)
- Created `scripts/setup-server.sh` with automatic directory detection
- Added permission checking and fallback mechanisms

### 16. GitLab CI/CD Variables and Security Configuration

**Problem**: Secure management of API keys and deployment credentials.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple API keys needed for different services
- SSH private key required for deployment
- Environment variables needed across different deployment stages

**Solution**: 
- Comprehensive GitLab CI/CD variable configuration:
  - `DEPLOY_SERVER`: Target server IP
  - `DEPLOY_USER`: SSH username
  - `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key for authentication
  - `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`: Weather service API key
  - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: Google Maps integration
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY`: Mapbox mapping service
- Configured proper masking and protection settings
- Created SSH key generation scripts for both Windows and Linux

### 17. GitLab Runner vs. Shared Runner Configuration

**Problem**: Confusion about GitLab Runner token requirements and setup complexity.

**Root Cause**: 
- Initial assumption that custom GitLab Runner was required
- Complexity of Runner registration and Docker-in-Docker setup
- Unclear distinction between shared and self-hosted runners

**Solution**: 
- Clarified GitLab Runner options:
  - **Option 1**: Use GitLab.com shared runners (no token needed)
  - **Option 2**: Self-hosted Runner with registration token
  - **Option 3**: Simplified SSH-based deployment (no Runner needed)
- Recommended simplified approach for reliability
- Provided comprehensive Runner setup documentation if needed
- Created troubleshooting guides for all approaches

### 18. Project File Organization and Cleanup

**Problem**: Redundant CI/CD configuration files and unnecessary scripts.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple CI/CD configuration files created during testing
- One-time use scripts no longer needed
- Unclear project structure for maintenance

**Solution**: 
- Systematic file cleanup:
  - Removed `.gitlab-ci-simple.yml` (merged into main config)
  - Deleted `scripts/switch-to-simple-cicd.bat` (one-time use)
  - Retained essential scripts: `setup-server.sh`, `test-config.sh`
- Updated project documentation to reflect final structure
- Created backup directory for reference materials
- Standardized all code comments to English

### 19. Docker Compose Environment Management

**Problem**: Complex environment variable management across development and production.

**Root Cause**: 
- Different port configurations for staging vs. production
- Build-time vs. runtime environment variables
- Next.js requirement for `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables at build time

**Solution**: 
- Created separate Docker Compose configurations:
  - `docker-compose.yml` for development/staging
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production deployment
- Implemented dynamic environment variable injection in CI/CD
- Added build-time ARG passing for Next.js public variables
- Configured proper service networking and port mapping

### 20. Deployment Automation and Monitoring

**Problem**: Need for automated deployment with proper monitoring and rollback capabilities.

**Root Cause**: 
- Manual deployment processes prone to errors
- No deployment status monitoring
- Lack of rollback mechanisms

**Solution**: 
- Implemented automated deployment pipeline:
  - Staging deployment on `develop` branch push
  - Production deployment on `main` branch (manual trigger)
- Added deployment status monitoring with container health checks
- Created comprehensive logging and debugging tools
- Implemented automatic service restart on failure

## ✅ PROBLEM SOLVED: ML API Nginx Routing Issue

### Problem
The ML API was not accessible via `http://137.43.49.26/api/ml/` because:
- Flask ML API only had `/predict-all` endpoint
- Nginx was proxying `/api/ml/` to Flask root `/` which had no handler
- No health check or API information endpoints

### Solution
1. **Added Flask root route** - Added `/` endpoint to provide API information
2. **Added health check endpoint** - Added `/health` endpoint for monitoring
3. **Enhanced Nginx configuration** - Added specific routes for each ML API endpoint
4. **Created deployment script** - Added `fix-ml-api.sh` for automated deployment

### Files Modified
- `ml/app.py` - Added root and health endpoints
- `nginx.conf` - Added specific ML API endpoint routing
- `scripts/fix-ml-api.sh` - New deployment script

### Available ML API Endpoints
- `http://137.43.49.26/api/ml/` - API information and status
- `http://137.43.49.26/api/ml/predict-all` - Get busyness predictions
- `http://137.43.49.26/api/ml/health` - Health check endpoint

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Environment Variables**: Next.js requires build-time access to `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables
2. **Network Binding**: Docker containers must bind to `0.0.0.0` for external access
3. **Nginx Proxy**: Essential for resolving network/firewall issues
4. **Volume Mounts**: Can cause conflicts in CI/CD; prefer image-based deployments
5. **Build Args**: Required for passing secrets during Docker build process
6. **YAML Syntax**: GitLab CI/CD is very sensitive to YAML formatting; use literal strings (`|`) for complex scripts
7. **GitLab Runners**: Don't always need custom runners; shared runners work for most use cases
8. **SSH Authentication**: Proper SSH key setup is crucial for CI/CD deployment automation
9. **Mixed Languages**: Standardize code comments and messages in English for better maintainability
10. **Deployment Architecture**: Local development environment vs. remote deployment server distinction is important
