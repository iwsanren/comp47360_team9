# CI/CD Pipeline Fix Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved
The CI/CD pipeline was failing because the `.env` file was not available in the deployment directory. This happened because:
1. `.env` is in `.gitignore` (correctly, for security)
2. `cp -r . /deployment/dir/` doesn't copy ignored files
3. `docker-compose.yml` uses `env_file: .env` but the file was missing

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed docker-compose.prod.yml
- **Removed** problematic volume mounts that caused deployment issues
- **Added** `env_file: .env` configuration for both services
- **Updated** environment variables to match staging config

### 2. Updated .gitlab-ci.yml
- **Added** automatic `.env` file creation in deployment directory
- **Included** all required environment variables:
  - `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
  - `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` 
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_API_KEY`
  - `NODE_ENV`
  - `FLASK_ENV`
- **Separated** staging and production deployment directories
- **Added** debug output to show .env file contents

### 3. Created Testing Scripts
- `scripts/test-docker-setup.sh` - Linux/Mac testing
- `scripts/test-docker-setup.bat` - Windows testing
- Both scripts validate the docker-compose setup locally

## üß™ How to Test

### Local Testing (Before Push)
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./scripts/test-docker-setup.sh

# Windows
scripts\test-docker-setup.bat
```

### CI/CD Testing
1. **Staging**: Push to `develop` branch
   - Deploys to http://137.43.49.26:3030
   - Uses `/tmp/team9-deploy/staging/`

2. **Production**: Manual deploy from `main` branch
   - Deploys to http://137.43.49.26:8080
   - Uses `/tmp/team9-deploy/production/`

## üîç Debugging

### Check CI/CD Logs
Look for these sections in GitLab CI/CD logs:
```
Creating .env file with environment variables...
.env file created:
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=***
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=***
...
```

### Check Container Status
The pipeline shows container status:
```
Container status:
Name                    Command               State           Ports
ml-api_1               python app.py            Up      0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp
webapp_1               npm start                Up      0.0.0.0:3030->3000/tcp
```

### Manual Verification on Server
```bash
# SSH to server
ssh root@137.43.49.26

# Check deployment directory
ls -la /tmp/team9-deploy/staging/
cat /tmp/team9-deploy/staging/.env

# Check containers
docker ps
docker-compose -f /tmp/team9-deploy/staging/docker-compose.yml ps
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Push to develop branch** to test staging deployment
2. **Verify services are accessible** at http://137.43.49.26:3030
3. **Test API endpoints** (weather, maps, ML predictions)
4. **Create merge request** to main branch for production deployment

## üìù Key Files Changed

- `.gitlab-ci.yml` - Fixed .env file handling
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Removed volumes, added env_file
- `scripts/test-docker-setup.*` - Added local testing scripts
- `CONFIGURATION-SUMMARY.md` - Updated documentation

The pipeline should now successfully deploy both staging and production environments with all required environment variables properly configured.
